Creative aspects of the assignment:

1) Used transform and transition properties along with hover selector to make a clean and attractive UI. Used to implement basic yet effective animations without any external library. Example - Project gallery, nabber, social media icons.

2) Used font-awesome : Loaded entire font-awesome file in the CSS to effectively modify and play around with icons. Directly loading the icons makes styling and scaling the icons easy. Icons are used in the services section to illustrate the types of services. Also used in the contact section for social media links.

3) To make UI rich and attractive, html smooth scrolling is used.

4) Each section of the website has a dedicated color theme. This is done in order to break the monotony of a single color theme. Enhances the UI many folds.

6) Website is responsive for smaller screens and features a side menu which can be opened and closed with a single click. This is implemented via basic javascript code. The code is added in the script tag of the HTML.
